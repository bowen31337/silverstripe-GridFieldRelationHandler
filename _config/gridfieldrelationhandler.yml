# Backward compatibility class aliases for SilverStripe 4 code
#
# These aliases allow legacy code to continue using non-namespaced class names
# while the new SilverStripe 5 module uses PSR-4 namespaced classes.
#
# Example legacy code that will continue to work:
#   $handler = new GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler($object, 'Image');
#
# This will be automatically resolved to:
#   Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler

SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  # Base class alias
  GridFieldRelationHandler:
    class: Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldRelationHandler

  # Has-one relationship handler alias
  GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler:
    class: Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler

  # Many relationship handler alias
  GridFieldManyRelationHandler:
    class: Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldManyRelationHandler

  # Helper class aliases for has_many relationships
  GridFieldManyRelationHandler_HasManyList:
    class: Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldManyRelationHandler_HasManyList

  # Helper class aliases for many_many relationships
  GridFieldManyRelationHandler_ManyManyList:
    class: Arillo\GridFieldRelationHandler\GridField\GridFieldManyRelationHandler_ManyManyList
